## Live Events

If you'd like to participate in live games with ChatSnek, follow
[BattlesnakeOfficial](battlesnake-twitch) and [Xtagon](xtagon-twitch) on
Twitch.

## How It Works

ChatSnek listens for these commands in the Twitch chat for BattlesnakeOfficial:

- `!up`
- `!down`
- `!left`
- `!right`

When ChatSnek plays a turn for a game of Battlesnake, it waits a small amount
of time (depending on the game's timeout setting) and then plays the move
corresponding to the highest voted direction from the chat.

## Open Invite
