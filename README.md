# ChatSnek

Twitch chat plays [Battlesnake][battlesnake].

## How It Works

ChatSnek listens for these commands in the Twitch chat for BattlesnakeOfficial:

- `!up`
- `!down`
- `!left`
- `!right`

When ChatSnek plays a turn for a game of Battlesnake, it waits a small amount
of time (depending on the game's timeout setting) and then plays the move
corresponding to the most recently seen command in the chat.

## Open Invite

If you have any questions, or just wish to geek out and chat about Battlesnake
